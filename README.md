**LIGHTHOUSE Python-based Preventive Maintenance Management System**

**Key Features of a Python-based CMMS:**

1. **Asset Management:** A Python-based CMMS enables comprehensive tracking of all assets, from industrial machinery to IT equipment. Each asset is described with technical details, maintenance history, and location.

2. **Preventive Maintenance Scheduling:** Planning is crucial in preventive maintenance. Python provides the necessary tools to create maintenance calendars, schedule inspections and tasks, and send automatic notifications to responsible technicians.

3. **Maintenance History Logging:** A Python-based CMMS records all maintenance interventions performed, including details such as date, duration, replaced parts, and associated costs. This facilitates performance tracking and the identification of assets requiring special attention.

4. **Spare Parts Inventory Management:** To avoid delays in maintenance, the system can include spare parts inventory management, providing information on the availability of necessary components for repairs.

5. **Report Generation and Analysis:** Python allows for the generation of custom reports on maintenance status, asset performance, and associated costs. These reports are valuable for decision-making and resource optimization.

6. **Integration with Sensors and IoT:** Python is ideal for integrating sensors and IoT devices that provide real-time data on asset status. This enables more accurate monitoring and early problem detection.

**Advantages of a Python-based CMMS:**

- **Flexibility:** Python is a versatile language that allows for system customization according to the specific needs of an organization.

- **Active Community:** Python has an active developer community and a wide range of libraries and frameworks that facilitate CMMS development and implementation.

- **Cost Savings:** Being open-source, Python can reduce licensing and development costs, making the CMMS more accessible to businesses of all sizes.

- **Scalability:** Python is suitable for both small businesses and large corporations, allowing the CMMS to grow with the organization.

**Conclusion:**
A Python-based Preventive Maintenance Management System is a powerful tool for keeping an organization's assets in optimal condition and reducing maintenance costs. Its flexibility, customization capabilities, and active developer community make Python a solid choice for implementing efficient and effective CMMS across a wide range of industries.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In today's digital era, efficient asset management and the prevention of equipment and machinery failures are crucial to ensure the continuity of operations in various industries. A Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is an essential tool for scheduling and monitoring maintenance activities with the goal of avoiding unplanned disruptions and costly repairs. In this context, the use of the Python programming language has gained popularity in creating CMMS, allowing for greater flexibility and customization in its implementation.

### Installing

Go to the command prompt and use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL. Git will start cloning the repository into your current directory. Once it's finished, you'll have created a local copy of the repository on your computer.

```
https://github.com/codigoferoz/Lighthouse.git
```

Now you have the cloned repository on your Windows system, but you can't start working with it. You need to convert the code into an executable file for Windows operating system.

Here are the steps to convert a Python file into an executable (.exe) file that can be run on Windows using PyInstaller:

**Step 1: Install PyInstaller**

If you don't already have PyInstaller installed, you can do so using the `pip` package manager. Open the Windows Command Prompt and run the following command to install PyInstaller:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

**Step 2: Navigate to the Python File's Directory**

Use the command prompt to navigate to the directory where your Python file you want to convert into an executable is located. For example:

```
cd C:\Path\To\Directory
```

**Step 3: Convert the Python File into an Executable**

Run PyInstaller with the following command, replacing "yourfilename.py" with the name of your Python file:

```
pyinstaller --onefile yourfilename.py
```

This will create a folder named "dist" in the current directory, and within that folder, you will find the `.exe` executable file with the same name as your Python file.

**Step 4: Run the .exe File**

You can now run the generated `.exe` file in the "dist" folder to execute your Python program on Windows without needing to have Python installed on the target machine.

Note: Depending on the complexity of your program and the libraries you use, you may need to adjust PyInstaller's configuration to include all necessary dependencies in the executable file. You can refer to the PyInstaller documentation for detailed information on additional configuration options if needed.

Keep in mind that the process of converting to an executable may make the resulting file larger, as it will include all the necessary libraries to run the program independently.
